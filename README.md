This project was built as a personal project to practice using react.

I wanted to build something that I would actually use for this project so I decided to build a debt snowball app. 

The app is meant to take in the users debt information and to graph out a visual representation
of how long it will take to pay off all of his or her debt if he/she continues to pay the same amount 
toward their debts each month until they are all paid off. That amount is calculated by adding up all 
of the minimum payments for the debts and then added to a number that the user would also like to pay 
in addition to the minimum payments. The information is then graphed using a Chart.js stacked bar 
chart. The debts will be paid smallest to largest as per the dave ramsey method. I might add an 
option to have the debts paid off from the highest interest rate first down to the smallest in the 
future but we will start with smallest to largest. I will also calculate the money you saved by using 
the debt snowball method instead of just paying the minimum payments.
